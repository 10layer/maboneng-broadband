				<h2>Maboneng: the most connected place in Africa Protoscape installs super-fast Fibre-Optic network in Maboneng.</h2>

				<p>The pure glass fibres of the FTTx network firmly embedded in the architecture of Maboneng gives the precinct a sharp cutting-edge in communications and a clear view of the future. Mark Seftel, Chairman of Protoscape, is the person behind the innovative point-to-point optical fibre technology that will make Maboneng the most connected place in Africa.</p>

				<p>As workers dug underground trenches and drilled through walls in June 2012, linking Maboneng and London with an unbroken, hair-thin line of glass, Seftel explained why he chose fiber-optic technology. Compared with copper networks, glass fibres lose less signal and are immune to electromagnetic interference, making fibre-optic networks faster and more reliable. “This is cutting-edge technology that will leave copper networks in the dust, and unlike copper, there’s no incentive for anyone to steal the cables.”</p>

				<p>“Essentially this is a fixed-line triple-play network that carries enough data to integrate broadband internet, voice telephony and HD television.” Seftel fires off facts and technical acronyms at speed, as if racing the super-fast FTTx network, which is very fast indeed. “Although capable of much more, the network currently delivers data from 1Mbps on standard installations, customisable to up to 1024Mbps for specialized requirements.”</p>

				<p>Those less fluent in techno-speak will be pleased to know that users deal with a simple and compact Tilgen device. The Tilgen router is easy to use and configure but it is also very smart. It takes in high speed data delivered by one of the four optical-fibre stands and directs the data, as needed, to a Wireless Access Point (for your own Wifi network) as well as four Ethernet ports. It also has two analogue phone jacks, one for a regular Telkom phone which allows you to make free calls to anyone else on the network and the other if you really still require a fax machine.</p>

				<p>This still leaves three strands of fiber in each unit. The second strand can be used to connect to a centralised DSTV dish which once converted can be plugged into your trusted DSTV decoder for HD reception. The remaining two strands of fibre are purely there for redundancy.</p>

				<h2>Fibre To The X (FTTx)</h2>
				
				<img src="public/images/fibre_cable.jpg" alt="Fibre to the X">

				<p>Maboneng’s Fibre to the home (FTTH) makes other networks look slow, expensive and out of date. FTTx is a generic term for broadband architecture using optical fibre instead of metal in the local loop, which links a communications network with users.</p>

				<p>According to the Broadband Tariff Benchmark Report, when it comes cost per bit, fibre-optic is the fastest and most cost effective network solution. DSL is slower and more costly (per Mbps) than cable and fibre-optic and when it comes to speed, fibre-optic is in a league of its own. The cost of Maboneng’s fibre-optic services matches Telkom’s DSL pricing but offers more value with speeds of up to 1Gbps.</p>

				<p>“Point-to-point fibre optic networks outrank and outclass passive optical networks as well as fixed (copper and glass) networks” says Mark Seftel. “We have raised the bar for broadband infrastructure and communication services in South Africa”.</p>

				<h3>FTTx: SA’s broadband solution?</h3>
				<p>“Broadband is key to economic activity. Access to fast, reliable and affordable internet doesn’t just stimulate economic growth and innovation. Advances in ICT translate into stronger communities, better government delivery, a more nurturing environment for small businesses - all of that means that our city becomes healthier in all sorts of ways – economically, politically, socially, environmentally and even aesthetically,” says Seftel.</p>

				<p>Internet Communications Technology(ICT) is one of South Africa’s leading sectors contributing 7% to the country’s GDP. Internet access (highest in Johannesburg with only 15% of households having access) is seen as vital for economic transformation, but the ICT sector and the economy as a whole are hamstrung by low levels of broadband internet access and weak provision of infrastructure.</p>

				<p>“South Africa urgently needs high-quality network provision and greater liberalisation of telecommunications,” Seftel says. The network in Maboneng delivers a quality last mile solution but it is still unfortunately hamstrung by expensive backhaul costs, but at least it has the architecture and the business model to respond very rapidly to the inevitable reduction in wholesale bandwidth which it will supply to its customers.</p>
